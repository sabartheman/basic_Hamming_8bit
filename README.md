# basic_Hamming_8bit


This is just a short script in matlab I wrote for some of my thesis work.

Using Matlab's hdl-coder tool this code will create an encoding and decoding method that is small and fast.  Only capable of correcting 1 bit error in a 8 bit word.  Will output where the error position is as well.
